# ðŸš€ FITFOAI Autonomous Pipeline - One-Click Start

## Copy & Paste This Entire Block to Start:

```markdown
# ðŸ¤– AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE ACTIVATED
# This will run continuously without intervention until quota limit

## INITIALIZATION
Setting up parallel development pipeline for FITFOAI. Agents will work autonomously in overlapping cycles. Each agent completes their phase and immediately moves to the next sprint while downstream agents process their output.

## SPRINT QUEUE
1. GPS Run Tracking (3.1)
2. Voice Coaching (3.2)  
3. Spotify Integration (3.3)
4. Training Plans (3.4)
5. Social Features (3.5)
6. Achievements (3.6)

## BEGIN AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION

@product-manager You are now in [AUTONOMOUS-MODE]. Start immediately:
SPRINT 3.1 (GPS Tracking): Create complete user stories with acceptance criteria for GPS run tracking feature. Include: location permissions, background tracking, accuracy requirements, battery optimization, and data persistence. Once complete, tag [3.1-READY-FOR-DEV] and IMMEDIATELY start planning Sprint 3.2 (Voice Coaching) without waiting. Continue this pattern through all 6 sprints.

@backend-ml-database-expert @android-ui-designer @devops-architecture-engineer You are now in [AUTONOMOUS-MODE]. 
INSTRUCTION: Monitor for [X.X-READY-FOR-DEV] tags from PM. When you see one:
- Backend: Implement all services, APIs, and database components
- Frontend: Build all UI screens and components with blue/coral theme  
- DevOps: Handle build, infrastructure, and architectural needs
When YOUR part is complete, tag [X.X-DEV-COMPLETE] and immediately start the next sprint that PM has tagged as ready. Work in parallel, don't wait for each other.

@qa-testing-specialist You are now in [AUTONOMOUS-MODE].
INSTRUCTION: Monitor for [X.X-DEV-COMPLETE] tags. When you see one, immediately begin comprehensive testing: unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, performance validation. Tag [X.X-TESTED] when complete and move to next available sprint. Document bugs with [BUG-PX] priority tags but don't block the pipeline unless P0.

## PIPELINE RULES
1. NO WAITING: As soon as you hand off, start the next task
2. PARALLEL WORK: Multiple sprints in different stages simultaneously  
3. AUTO-ESCALATE: If blocked for >10 minutes, tag [BLOCKED] and skip
4. CONTINUOUS FLOW: PM can be on Sprint 4 while Dev on Sprint 2 and QA on Sprint 1
5. QUALITY GATES: P0 bugs stop pipeline, P1-P3 go to backlog

## STATUS REPORTING
@product-manager Every 30 minutes provide:
PIPELINE STATUS [Time]
- Active Sprints: [list with stages]
- Completed: [count]
- Velocity: [points/hour]
- Health: ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´

## START NOW
All agents begin immediately. PM start Sprint 3.1 planning. Others prepare to receive work. Execute continuously without further instruction.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens Next:

Once you paste the above command:

1. **Product Manager** starts creating Sprint 3.1 stories (GPS Tracking)
2. **After ~15 mins**: PM finishes 3.1, tags it, starts 3.2 (Voice) 
3. **Dev Team** sees tag, starts building 3.1 while PM plans 3.2
4. **After ~30 mins**: Devs finish 3.1, tag it, start 3.2
5. **QA** sees tag, tests 3.1 while Devs build 3.2 and PM plans 3.3
6. **Continuous**: This pattern continues through all 6 sprints

## ðŸ“Š Expected Timeline:

| Hour | PM Working On | Devs Building | QA Testing |
|------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| 0:00-0:30 | Sprint 3.1 Planning | Waiting | Waiting |
| 0:30-1:00 | Sprint 3.2 Planning | Sprint 3.1 | Waiting |
| 1:00-1:30 | Sprint 3.3 Planning | Sprint 3.2 | Sprint 3.1 |
| 1:30-2:00 | Sprint 3.4 Planning | Sprint 3.3 | Sprint 3.2 |
| 2:00-2:30 | Sprint 3.5 Planning | Sprint 3.4 | Sprint 3.3 |
| 2:30-3:00 | Sprint 3.6 Planning | Sprint 3.5 | Sprint 3.4 |
| 3:00-3:30 | Backlog Grooming | Sprint 3.6 | Sprint 3.5 |
| 3:30-4:00 | Metrics & Reports | Bug Fixes | Sprint 3.6 |

## ðŸ›‘ To Stop:

Simply type:
```
STOP AUTONOMOUS PIPELINE - All agents halt current work and provide final status.
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips:

1. **Let it run**: Check back every hour
2. **Trust the agents**: They'll escalate real blockers
3. **Review later**: Check the generated code and tests
4. **Optimize next run**: Adjust sprint sizes based on velocity
