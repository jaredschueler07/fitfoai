Injury Prevention Basics

- Load Management: 5–10% weekly increases; deload every 3–4 weeks.
- Strength: 2×/week focusing on calves, glutes, hamstrings, and core.
- Running Form: cadence 170–180 as a guide; avoid overstriding; relaxed upper body.
- Surfaces & Shoes: rotate shoes; vary terrain; replace worn-out footwear.
- Pain Rules: 0–3/10 OK; 4–5 modify; ≥6 stop and rest; persistent pain → clinician.
- Return-to-Run: pain-free walking first; reintroduce easy intervals (run/walk) before intensity.
