Key Principles for Endurance Training

- Base First: build easy aerobic mileage before intensity; increase weekly load by ~5–10%.
- Intensity Variety: include easy runs, one quality session (tempo/intervals), and a weekly long run.
- Progress Gradually: add either duration, frequency, or intensity—not all at once; deload every 3–4 weeks.
- Specificity: match workouts to your goal pace and terrain closer to race day.
- Recovery Matters: sleep 7–9 h; schedule rest/easy days; monitor soreness and mood.
- Strength & Mobility: 2 sessions/week focusing on posterior chain, core, and single-leg stability.

Example Weekly Structure (intermediate)

- Mon: Rest or 30–40 min easy
- Tue: Intervals (e.g., 5×3 min at 5–10K effort; equal jog recoveries)
- Wed: 40–60 min easy + mobility
- Thu: Tempo 20–30 min at comfortably hard
- Fri: Rest or 30–40 min easy + strides
- Sat: 30–45 min easy or cross-train
- Sun: Long run 70–120 min easy
