Everyday Nutrition for Runners

- Energy: match intake to training load; modest deficit only outside heavy training blocks.
- Protein: ~1.4–1.8 g/kg/day spread across meals (20–35 g per meal) for recovery.
- Carbohydrates: higher on hard/long days; include pre-run carbs and post-run replenishment.
- Fats: include healthy sources (olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish) for hormones and satiety.
- Micronutrients: iron (especially if fatigue), calcium/vit D, and electrolytes.

Training Day Fueling

- 2–3 h pre-run: balanced meal (carb-focused, moderate protein, low fat/fiber).
- 15–30 min pre-run (optional): small carb snack if needed.
- During long runs (>75–90 min): 30–60 g carb/hour; hydrate with electrolytes.
- Post-run (30–60 min): carb + 20–35 g protein; rehydrate 1.5× fluid lost if very sweaty.
