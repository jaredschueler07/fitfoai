# üöÄ FITFOAI Autonomous Pipeline v2.0 - With Git Integration

## Copy & Paste This Entire Block to Start:

```markdown
# ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE v2.0 ACTIVATED
# Includes Git version control and PRD maintenance
# This will run continuously without intervention until quota limit

## INITIALIZATION
Setting up parallel development pipeline for FITFOAI with integrated version control. Agents will work autonomously in overlapping cycles with automatic git commits and PRD updates.

## GIT SETUP
All agents will follow this git workflow:
- Branch naming: feature/[sprint-number]-[component]
- Commit format: [AGENT][SPRINT] Description
- Auto-commit every 30 minutes or at task completion
- PR creation when sprint complete

## SPRINT QUEUE
1. GPS Run Tracking (3.1)
2. Voice Coaching (3.2)  
3. Spotify Integration (3.3)
4. Training Plans (3.4)
5. Social Features (3.5)
6. Achievements (3.6)

## BEGIN AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION

@product-manager You are now in [AUTONOMOUS-MODE]. Start immediately:

SPRINT 3.1 (GPS Tracking): 
1. Update `/project/fitfoai-claude-prd.md` with sprint details
2. Create complete user stories with acceptance criteria
3. Document in PRD: requirements, risks, success metrics
4. Git commit: `git add . && git commit -m "[PM][3.1] Sprint planning and PRD update"`
5. Once complete, tag [3.1-READY-FOR-DEV] 
6. IMMEDIATELY start Sprint 3.2 planning
7. Continue updating PRD for each sprint

@backend-ml-database-expert @android-ui-designer @devops-architecture-engineer You are now in [AUTONOMOUS-MODE].

GIT WORKFLOW:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[sprint]-[your-component]`
2. Implement your components
3. Commit every 30 mins: `git add . && git commit -m "[AGENT][SPRINT] Progress update"`
4. When complete, final commit: `git add . && git commit -m "[AGENT][SPRINT] Component complete"`
5. Tag [X.X-DEV-COMPLETE] and switch to next sprint

DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTION: 
Monitor for [X.X-READY-FOR-DEV] tags from PM. When you see one:
- Backend: Implement all services, APIs, and database components
- Frontend: Build all UI screens and components with blue/coral theme  
- DevOps: Handle build, infrastructure, and architectural needs

@qa-testing-specialist You are now in [AUTONOMOUS-MODE].

TESTING WORKFLOW:
1. Create test branch: `git checkout -b test/[sprint]-validation`
2. Write and execute comprehensive tests
3. Commit test results: `git add . && git commit -m "[QA][SPRINT] Test suite complete"`
4. Document bugs in PRD via PM
5. Tag [X.X-TESTED] when complete

INSTRUCTION: Monitor for [X.X-DEV-COMPLETE] tags. Begin testing immediately.

## PIPELINE RULES
1. NO WAITING: As soon as you hand off, start the next task
2. PARALLEL WORK: Multiple sprints in different stages simultaneously  
3. AUTO-COMMIT: Git commits every 30 minutes minimum
4. PRD UPDATES: PM maintains `/project/fitfoai-claude-prd.md` continuously
5. BRANCH STRATEGY: Each sprint gets feature branches
6. QUALITY GATES: P0 bugs stop pipeline, P1-P3 go to backlog

## GIT COMMIT SCHEDULE
Every 30 minutes, ALL AGENTS execute:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[AGENT][SPRINT-X.X] Checkpoint: [brief description]"
git push origin [your-branch]
```

## STATUS REPORTING
@product-manager Every 30 minutes:
1. Update PRD with progress
2. Commit PRD changes
3. Provide status:
   PIPELINE STATUS [Time]
   - Active Sprints: [list with stages]
   - Completed: [count]
   - Git commits: [count]
   - PRD sections updated: [list]
   - Velocity: [points/hour]
   - Health: üü¢/üü°/üî¥

## BRANCH MANAGEMENT
Sprint branches to be created:
- feature/3.1-gps-tracking
- feature/3.2-voice-coaching
- feature/3.3-spotify
- feature/3.4-training-plans
- feature/3.5-social
- feature/3.6-achievements

## PRD SECTIONS TO MAINTAIN
@product-manager ensure these PRD sections stay current:
- Sprint Progress (update every 30 mins)
- Completed Features (when QA signs off)
- Risk Register (as identified)
- Technical Decisions (as made)
- Roadmap Adjustments (based on velocity)
- Success Metrics (actual vs target)

## START NOW
All agents begin immediately. 
1. PM: Update PRD and start Sprint 3.1 planning
2. Others: Prepare branches and await work
3. Everyone: Set 30-minute commit reminders

Execute continuously without further instruction.
