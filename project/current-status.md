## 🔧 BUILD SYSTEM STATUS

### **✅ EXCELLENT - Modern Versions Already In Place**
```kotlin
// Current Build Configuration (PERFECT!)
Android Gradle Plugin: 8.12.1 ⭐ (Latest)
Kotlin: 2.0.21 ⭐ (Latest) 
Java Target: 11 ✅ (Modern)
Compose BOM: 2024.09.00 ✅ (Recent)
API Level: 36 ✅ (Latest)
```

### **🎯 Ready for Production**
- **No Version Upgrades Needed**: Build system is already modern
- **Compose Compiler**: Using Kotlin Compose Plugin (latest approach)
- **Java 11**: Already configured correctly
- **Dependencies**: Need to add Hilt, Room, Ktor for features

### **📦 Dependencies to Add**
```kotlin
// Phase 1 Dependencies
Hilt: "2.48" (Dependency Injection)
Room: "2.6.1" (Local Database)
Navigation Compose: (Screen Navigation)
Ktor: "2.3.7" (HTTP Client)
```

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS - PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION

### **✅ Ready to Begin Development**
- ✅ **Modern Build System**: No version upgrades needed
- ✅ **Architecture Plan**: Clean Architecture defined
- ✅ **Design System**: Wireframe reference available
- ✅ **PRD Updated**: All requirements aligned with v1.1

### **📋 Phase 1 Tasks (Starting Now)**
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create Clean Architecture folder structure
   - Add dependencies (Hilt, Room, Navigation, Ktor)
   - Set up dependency injection modules

2. **Theme & UI Foundation**
   - Implement Material 3 dark theme with lime accents
   - Create reusable UI components matching wireframe
   - Set up navigation structure

3. **Screen Implementation**
   - Welcome Screen with hero design
   - Connect Apps Screen (Google Fit, Spotify)
   - Profile, Goal Setting, Dashboard screens
   - AI Coach screen with Fitness Coach AI Agent

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 1

### **Foundation Goals**
- [ ] Clean Architecture project structure implemented
- [ ] All dependencies added and configured correctly
- [ ] Material 3 dark theme with lime accents working
- [ ] Navigation flow between all screens functional
- [ ] Reusable UI component library created

### **Screen Implementation Goals**
- [ ] Welcome Screen with hero design and "Get Started" button
- [ ] Connect Apps Screen with Google Fit + Spotify integration UI
- [ ] Personalize Profile Screen with form validation
- [ ] Set Event Goal Screen with race selection
