#### Sprint 3.4: Critical Architecture & Integration Fixes üö® ACTIVE SPRINT
**Sprint Duration**: August 29 - September 4, 2025 (5 business days)
**Sprint Goal**: Resolve all P0 blockers and establish proper data flow architecture
**Priority**: P0 - Critical for Production Release

**Sprint Objectives**:
1. Fix all duplicate dependency injection issues
2. Restore Google Fit integration functionality  
3. Establish proper repository pattern usage
4. Fix test infrastructure and package naming
5. Replace placeholder data with real user data flow

**Critical Architecture Issues Identified**:

**P0 - Database Architecture Crisis (Days 1-2)**:
- **Duplicate Room Database Instances**: AppContainer creates one instance, Composables create another via `FITFOAIDatabase.getDatabase()` - causing data inconsistency
- **PermissionManager Context Issue**: Casting generic Context to ComponentActivity in AppContainer line 65 will crash
- **Repository in Composables**: DashboardScreen lines 33-34 create database and repository directly in Composable causing performance issues
- **Package Naming Mismatch**: Tests expect `com.example.fitfoai` but actual package is `com.runningcoach.v2` - all tests failing

**P1 - Data Flow Breakdown (Days 3-4)**:
- **Google Fit Permission Gap**: Sign-in succeeds but permission requests never happen, blocking data access
- **Placeholder Data Lock-in**: Real user profile data exists in database but UI shows hardcoded sample data
- **Missing Error Feedback**: No user-visible error messages when Google Fit sync fails
- **Main Thread Database Access**: Heavy database operations in UI thread causing ANR risks

**P2 - Architecture Improvements (Day 5)**:
- **HttpClient Duplication**: Multiple HttpClient instances instead of centralized singleton
- **Unused OAuth Code**: Deep-link OAuth handling code that's not used
- **Missing Integration Tests**: No end-to-end tests for critical user flows

3. **Real User Data**: Create methods to fetch actual user profile from database instead of hardcoded values
4. **Background Threading**: Wrap all database operations in `withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { }`
5. **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages for all data operations

#### android-ui-designer Tasks:
**Primary Focus**: UI performance, ViewModels, error feedback, user experience
**Key Files to Modify**:
- `/app/src/main/java/com/runningcoach/v2/presentation/screen/dashboard/DashboardScreen.kt` - Remove repository creation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Risk: Database Migration During Sprint
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: 
- Test database changes with app data backup/restore
- Implement rollback strategy if migration fails  
- Version control database schema changes carefully

#### Risk: Google Fit API Rate Limits
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement exponential backoff for API calls
- Cache data locally to reduce API requests
- Add user messaging for rate limit scenarios

#### Risk: Breaking Changes to Permission Flow
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Test permission flows on multiple Android versions (10, 11, 12, 13, 14)
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Add graceful degradation for denied permissions

#### Risk: Performance Regression from Architecture Changes
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
