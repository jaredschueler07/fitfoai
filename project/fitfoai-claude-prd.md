## üè∑Ô∏è Product Decisions Log

### [PRODUCT-DECISION-3.1.1] Location Provider Strategy
**Decision**: Migrate from LocationManager to FusedLocationProvider API
**Rationale**: Better accuracy, battery efficiency, and handles provider switching automatically
**Impact**: Breaking change to LocationService, requires testing across devices
**Owner**: Backend Agent | **Date**: 2025-01-27

### [PRODUCT-DECISION-3.1.2] GPS Accuracy Standards
**Decision**: Target 90% of location points within 10m accuracy, filter points >20m accuracy
**Rationale**: Balance between accuracy and reliability across different devices and conditions
**Impact**: Affects distance calculation accuracy and user trust
**Owner**: Product Manager | **Date**: 2025-01-27

### [PRODUCT-DECISION-3.1.3] Auto-Pause Thresholds
**Decision**: Auto-pause after 30s stationary, auto-resume when >2 m/s for 10s
**Rationale**: Tested values that work well for running vs walking distinction
**Impact**: User experience for traffic lights, rest stops, and warmup periods
**Owner**: Product Manager | **Date**: 2025-01-27

### [PRODUCT-DECISION-3.1.4] Battery Optimization Target
**Decision**: Maximum 7% battery drain per hour of GPS tracking
**Rationale**: Allows for 2+ hour long runs without significant battery impact
**Impact**: May require reduced location accuracy in power-saving scenarios
**Owner**: Product Manager | **Date**: 2025-01-27

### [PRODUCT-DECISION-3.1.5] Background Service Strategy
**Decision**: Implement RunTrackingForegroundService as Priority 1 for Sprint 3.2
**Rationale**: Critical for user experience - runs must continue when phone is locked/backgrounded
**Impact**: Enables real-world usage, directly affects user retention and app utility
**Owner**: Product Manager | **Date**: 2025-08-29

### [PRODUCT-DECISION-3.1.6] Auto-Pause Thresholds Refinement
**Decision**: Refine auto-pause to 45-second stationary detection, 3 m/s resume speed
**Rationale**: Current 30s/2m/s too sensitive based on testing feedback
**Impact**: Reduces false pauses at traffic lights, improves user experience
**Owner**: Product Manager | **Date**: 2025-08-29

## ü§ù Coordination & Communication

### Daily Sync Points
- **Morning**: Pull latest, check messages, plan day
- **Midday**: Progress update, blocker identification
- **Evening**: Push changes, update dashboard

### Escalation Path
1. Tag with `[BLOCKED]` in messages
2. Try alternative approach
3. Request help from specific agent
4. Escalate to `[P0-CRITICAL]` if needed

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- Code review by relevant agent
- Documentation updated
- No P0/P1 bugs
