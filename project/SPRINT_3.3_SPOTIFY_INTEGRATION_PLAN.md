## 🎯 RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### **High-Risk Items**

#### **1. Spotify API Rate Limiting**
**Risk**: API calls exceed rate limits during peak usage (especially during playlist generation)  
**Impact**: Music features become unavailable, user frustration  
**Mitigation**: \
- Implement aggressive request caching for track metadata
- Batch API calls where possible (e.g., fetching audio features for multiple tracks)
- Graceful degradation with cached data and **pre-generated playlists**
- User communication about temporary limitations

#### **2. Pre-Run BPM Matching Accuracy**
**Risk**: Inaccurate BPM matching during playlist generation disrupts user experience  
**Impact**: Music doesn't enhance running rhythm, feature abandonment  
**Mitigation**:\
- Multiple BPM detection algorithms with consensus for **track analysis**
- User feedback mechanism for BPM corrections
- Manual override controls always available (for playlist regeneration)
- Fallback to user's preferred tempo range if perfect match not found

#### **3. Audio Integration Complexity**
**Risk**: Voice coaching and music integration causes audio conflicts  
**Impact**: Poor user experience, audio artifacts, crashes  
**Mitigation**:\
- Extensive audio focus testing
- Priority-based audio queue management
- Device-specific audio handling optimizations
- Fallback to sequential audio (no simultaneous playback)

### **Medium-Risk Items**

#### **4. OAuth Token Management**
**Risk**: Token refresh failures cause connection loss  
**Impact**: Music features stop working (especially pre-run playlist generation)  
**Mitigation**:\
- Proactive token refresh before expiration
- Retry logic with user notification
- Offline mode with cached **pre-generated playlists**
- Quick reconnection flow

#### **5. Music Library Limitations**
**Risk**: User\'s library lacks suitable BPM matches for workout segments  
**Impact**: BPM matching features don\'t work effectively, limited playlist variety  
**Mitigation**:\
- Expand search to Spotify\'s full catalog for recommendations
- Genre-based fallback recommendations
- User education about building diverse playlists
- Partnership with playlist curators

### **Low-Risk Items**

#### **6. Performance Impact**
**Risk**: Music integration affects GPS tracking performance  
**Impact**: Core app functionality degraded  
**Mitigation**:\
- Background thread for all music operations (especially playlist generation)
- Memory optimization for audio caching
- Performance monitoring and alerts
- Music-off mode preserves core functionality
