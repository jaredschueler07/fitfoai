### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with domain, data, and presentation layers
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels manage UI state and business logic coordination
- **Single Activity Architecture**: MainActivity with Compose Navigation
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit with Material 3
- **Room Database**: Local data persistence with voice caching entities (v4 schema)
- **Background Services**: Foreground services for GPS tracking and crash recovery
- **Ktor Client**: HTTP networking for API calls (ElevenLabs, Gemini, etc.)
- **Coroutines + Flow**: Asynchronous programming and reactive data streams
- **Manual Dependency Injection**: AppModule pattern (Hilt disabled due to compatibility)

### Navigation Flow
1. **Onboarding**: Welcome → Connect Apps → Personalize Profile → Set Event Goal
2. **Main App**: Dashboard (with bottom nav to AI Coach, Progress, Profile)

## Common Development Patterns

### Working with Background Services
- **BackgroundLocationService**: Use `BackgroundLocationService.startService()` for GPS tracking
- **Service Integration**: Access via `RunSessionRepositoryImpl.startSessionWithBackgroundService()`
- **Crash Recovery**: Use `SessionRecoveryManager.saveRecoveryData()` for persistence
- **Permission Handling**: Use `PermissionManager.requestAllPermissions()` before service start

### Voice Coaching Integration
- **Coach Selection**: Use `CoachPersonalitySelector` component with `VoiceCoachingManager`
- **Trigger Configuration**: Configure coaching via `SmartTriggerEngine.configureTriggers()`
- **Audio Management**: Handle music ducking via `AudioFocusManager.requestAudioFocus()`
- **Voice Caching**: Use `VoiceCacheManager.preloadCoachingLines()` for offline support

### Adding New Screens
1. Create screen in `presentation/screen/[feature]/`
2. Add screen route to `presentation/navigation/Screen.kt`
3. Update navigation in `MainActivity.kt`
4. Create corresponding ViewModel if needed
5. Add comprehensive tests (unit + UI)
6. Ensure permission flows are handled if GPS/location needed

### Working with State and Background Data
- Use `StateFlow` for UI state management in ViewModels
- Leverage `RunSessionRepository.getRealTimeMetrics()` for live GPS data
- Follow unidirectional data flow patterns with background service integration
- Handle service lifecycle with proper cleanup in ViewModels

### Database Operations
- Implement Repository pattern for data access with caching
- Use Room v4 schema with voice caching entities (`VoiceLineEntity`, `CoachPersonalityEntity`)
- Handle migrations properly when adding new entities
- Use coroutines for asynchronous database operations
- Follow transaction patterns for multi-entity operations

### Testing Critical Functionality
- **P0 Tests**: Always test GPS background continuity, permission flows, crash recovery
- **Voice Tests**: Verify latency <200ms, audio focus management, coach personalities
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete run session workflows with background services
- **Performance Tests**: Battery usage, GPS accuracy, voice synthesis performance

### API Key Management
- Store keys in `local.properties` (never commit)
- Access via `BuildConfig.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, etc.
- Use test keys for development and CI/CD
- Implement proper error handling for API rate limits

This codebase represents a production-ready Android application with advanced background services, AI voice coaching, and comprehensive testing following modern development practices and clean architecture principles.
